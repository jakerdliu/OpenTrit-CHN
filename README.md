• OpenTrit, an open-source cross-framework mixed ternary toolkit, supports one-click conversion of mixed ternary models between PyTorch and TensorFlow. It encapsulates heterogeneous computing power scheduling and quantization optimization, addressing the issues of "framework dependency and poor usability" present in existing ternary tools.
